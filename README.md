# multiver

*like winver.exe on Windows but universally*

## purpose

this project is meant to replicate the experience of winver while being platform agnostic. yes, this should also work on Windows too lol.

## requirements

* python3
* tkinter

## usage

when multiver is summoned, it spawns a window with information in a similar fashion as winver.exe on Windows. and also like Windows, there are no option flags or anything fancy

```
  multiver.py [-h]

  -h  Calls this help menu (which is not useful).

  Summon multiver.py as it is a GUI program and not a CLI program.
```
