# multiver

*like winver.exe on Windows but universally and terribly executed*
![sample of multiver.py running on my macOS Sonoma machine](/assets/macos_sample.png)

## purpose

this project is meant to replicate the experience of winver while being platform agnostic. I'm feeling evil and making this run on Linux and macOS only
(maybe Windows itself will get release)

## requirements (also seen in requirements.txt)

* python3
* tkinter
* distro==1.9.0
* Pillow==10.2.0
* ttkbootstrap==1.10.1
